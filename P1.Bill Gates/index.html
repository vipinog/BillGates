          Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on October 28, 1955.[3] He
          is the son of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (1925–2020) and Mary Maxwell
          Gates (1929–1994).[22] His ancestry includes English, German, and
          Irish/Scots-Irish.[23] His father was a prominent lawyer, and his
          mother served on the board of directors for First Interstate
          BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates's maternal grandfather
          was J. W. Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has an older
          sister Kristi (Kristianne) and a younger sister Libby. He is the
          fourth of his name in his family but is known as William Gates III or
          "Trey" (i.e., three) because his father had the "II" suffix.[24][25]
          The family lived in the Sand Point area of Seattle in a home that was
          damaged by a rare tornado when Gates was seven years old.[26] Early in
          his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a law
          career.[27] When he was young, his family regularly attended a church
          of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed
          denomination.[28][29][30] Gates was small for his age and was bullied
          as a child.[25] The family encouraged competition; one visitor
          reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or
          swimming to the dock; there was always a reward for winning and there
          was always a penalty for losing".[31] Gates (right) with Paul Allen
          seated at Teletype Model 33 ASR terminals in Lakeside School, 1970 At
          13, he enrolled in the private Lakeside prep.

          Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics which
          demonstrated the Altair 8800, and he contacted Micro Instrumentation
          and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were
          working on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[54] In reality, Gates
          and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they
          merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts
          agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few
          weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer,
          and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's
          offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a
          deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS
          hired Allen,[55] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to
          work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership
          "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and
          their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and
          Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland.[55] They
          dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade
          name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on
          November 26, 1976.[55] Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his
          studies.

          IBM, the leading supplier of computer equipment to commercial
          enterprises at the time, approached Microsoft in July 1980 concerning
          software for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC,[60] after
          Bill Gates's mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, mentioned Microsoft to John
          Opel, IBM's CEO.[61] IBM first proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC
          interpreter. IBM's representatives also mentioned that they needed an
          operating system, and Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI),
          makers of the widely used CP/M operating system.[62] IBM's discussions
          with Digital Research went poorly, however, and they did not reach a
          licensing agreement. IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the
          licensing difficulties during a subsequent meeting with Gates and
          asked if Microsoft could provide an operating system. A few weeks
          later, Gates and Allen proposed using 86-DOS, an operating system
          similar to CP/M, that Tim Paterson of Seattle Computer Products (SCP)
          had made for hardware similar to the PC.[63] Microsoft made a deal
          with SCP to be the exclusive licensing agent of 86-DOS, and later the
          full owner. Microsoft employed Paterson to adapt the operating system
          for the PC[64] and delivered it to IBM as PC DOS for a one-time fee of
          $50,000

          Microsoft and Gates launched their first retail version of Microsoft
          Windows on November 20, 1985, in an attempt to fend off competition
          from Apple's Macintosh GUI, which had captivated consumers with its
          simplicity and ease of use.[69] In August of the following year, the
          company struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system
          called OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the
          first version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to
          mounting creative differences.[70] The operating system grew out of
          DOS in an organic fashion over a decade until Windows 95, which hid
          the DOS prompt by default. Windows XP, released one year after Gates
          stepped down as Microsoft CEO, was the first to not be based on
          DOS.[71] Windows 8.1 was the last version of the OS released before
          Gates left the chair of the firm to John W. Thompson on February 5,
          2014
